## Dataset 1: Indian Cars - Data Analysis and Visualization

### Overview
Around 3.34 Lakh passenger cars were sold in the Indian market in May 2023. The sales increased by over 13% when compared to May last year. The Top 25 Selling Cars constituted over 75% of the cars sold in April 2023.

### Steps for Univariate Analysis
1. **Understand Dataset:**
   - Get a sense of the dataset structure, including the number of rows and columns.
2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handle missing values, if any.
3. **Data Types:**
   - Check the data types of each column.
4. **Histograms:**
   - Visualize the distribution of key numeric variables (e.g., sales, price).
5. **Bar Charts:**
   - Represent the count of categorical variables (e.g., car models, manufacturers).
6. **Box Plots:**
   - Identify outliers and understand the distribution of numeric variables.
7. **Pie Charts:**
   - Represent the contribution of different car models or manufacturers.

### Steps for Bivariate Analysis
1. **Correlation Matrix:**
   - Understand relationships between numeric variables.
2. **Scatter Plots:**
   - Explore the relationship between two numeric variables.
3. **Pair Plots:**
   - Overview of relationships between multiple numeric variables.
4. **Bar Charts with Hue:**
   - Enhance bar charts by introducing the 'hue' parameter.
5. **Heatmaps:**
   - Visualize the correlation matrix for better insights.
6. **Box Plots with Hue:**
   - Enhance box plots by introducing the 'hue' parameter.
7. **Violin Plots:**
   - Visualize the distribution of numeric variables across different categories.

### Insights and Documentation
- Document key findings and insights obtained from both univariate and bivariate analyses. Use graphs and visualizations to support observations.

## Libraries Used for Visualization
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

8. **Sales Distribution by Category:**
   - Visualize the distribution of sales across different categories.
9. **Sales Variation Over Time:**
    - Plot line charts to observe how sales vary over different time periods.

### Steps for Bivariate Analysis
1. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - Examine the correlation between sales and other relevant numeric variables.
2. **Scatter Plots:**
   - Explore the relationship between sales and another numeric variable.
3. **Category-wise Sales Trends:**
   - Analyze how sales trends differ across different categories.
4. **Heatmaps:**
   - Visualize the correlation matrix for better insights.

### Document Findings
- Summarize key findings from both univariate and bivariate analyses. Highlight any notable trends or insights.
