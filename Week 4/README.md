This project is a recreation of Hans Rosling's groundbreaking motion graph from: 'The best stats you've ever seen' TED talk!

In 2006, Hans Rosling gave a TED talk titled "The best stats you've ever seen." It is recommended to watch this video before working on the project to understand the inspiration behind the visualization.

# Objective
Explore the realm of data visualization in Python by utilizing powerful libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. The task is to create visually engaging and informative plots, graphs, and charts based on a provided dataset.

# Dataset information
* Life expectancy at birth: The number of years a newborn would live if the patterns of mortality at the time of birth remain the same throughout his life.
* Fertility rate: Number of children a woman would give birth to during her childbearing years
* Country population: Total number of residents regardless of legal status or citizenship (midyear estimates)

# Additional Visualizations
* Population Trends (Years vs Population) (Line Graph)
* Fertility rate distribution
* Life expectancy variation
* Correlation Analysis
* Regional Analysis
