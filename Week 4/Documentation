World Bank Data Visualization Project

This project is a recreation of Hans Rosling's groundbreaking motion graph from: 'The best stats you've ever seen' TED talk!

In 2006, Hans Rosling gave a TED talk titled "The best stats you've ever seen." It is recommended to watch this video before working on the project to understand the inspiration behind the visualization.
